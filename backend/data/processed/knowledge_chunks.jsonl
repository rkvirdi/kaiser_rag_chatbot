If you want a \ncopy, you may have to put your request in writing and pay for the cost of copying and mailing. In most \ncases, your copies must be given to you within 30 days. \nCheck It. \nYou can ask to change any wrong information in your file or add information to your file if you think \nsomething is missing or incomplete. For example, if you and your hospital agree that your file has \nthe wrong result for a test, the hospital must change it. Even if the hospital believes the test result is \ncorrect, you still have the right to have your disagreement noted in your file. In most cases, the file \nshould be updated within 60 days. \nKnow Who Has Seen It. \nBy law, your health information can be used and shared for specific reasons not directly related to \nyour care, like making sure doctors give good care, making sure nursing homes are clean and safe, \nreporting when the flu is in your area, or reporting as required by state or federal law. In many of these \ncases, you can find out who has seen your health information. You can: \nLearn how your health information is used and shared by your doctor or health insurer. Generally, \nyour health information cannot be used for purposes not directly related to your care without your \npermission. For example, your doctor cannot give it to your employer, or share it for things like \nmarketing and advertising, without your written authorization. You probably received a notice telling \nyou how your health information may be used on your first visit to a new health care provider or \nwhen you got new health insurance, but you can ask for another copy anytime. \nLet your providers or health insurance companies know if there is information you do not want to \nshare. You can ask that your health information not be shared with certain people, groups, or \ncompanies. If you go to a clinic, for example, you can ask the doctor not to share your medical \nrecords with other doctors or nurses at the clinic.

EHRs allow providers to use \ninformation more effectively to improve the quality and efficiency of your care, but \nEHRs will not change the privacy protections or security safeguards that apply to your \nhealth information. \nEHRs and Your Health Information \nEHRs are electronic versions of the paper charts in your doctor’s or other health care provider’s office. \nAn EHR may include your medical history, notes, and other information about your health including your \nsymptoms, diagnoses, medications, lab results, vital signs, immunizations, and reports from diagnostic \ntests such as x-rays. \nProviders are working with other doctors, hospitals, and health plans to find ways to share that \ninformation. The information in EHRs can be shared with other organizations involved in your care \nif the computer systems are set up to talk to each other. Information in these records should only be \nshared for purposes authorized by law or by you. \nYou have privacy rights whether your information is stored as a paper record or stored in an \nelectronic form. The same federal laws that already protect your health information also apply to \ninformation in EHRs. \nBenefits of Having EHRs \nWhether your health care provider is just beginning to switch from paper records to EHRs or is already \nusing EHRs within the office, you will likely experience one or more of the following benefits: \nImproved Quality of Care. As your doctors begin to use EHRs and set up ways to securely \nshare your health information with other providers, it will make it easier for everyone to work \ntogether to make sure you are getting the care you need. For example: \nInformation about your medications will be available in EHRs so that health care providers \ndon’t give you another medicine that might be harmful to you. \nEHR systems are backed up like most computer systems, so if you are in an area affected \nby a disaster, like a hurricane, your health information can be retrieved. \nEHRs can be available in an emergency. If you are in an accident and are unable to explain \nyour health history, a hospital that has a system may be able to talk to your doctor’s system. \nThe hospital will get information about your medications, health issues, and tests, so decisions \nabout your emergency care are faster and more informed. \no\t \no\t \no\t \n•", "metadata": {"producer": "Adobe PDF Library 10.0.1", "creator": "Adobe InDesign CS6 (Macintosh)", "creationdate": "2013-02-06T13:23:38-05:00", "author": "Department of Health & Human Services USA", "gts_pdfxconformance": "PDF/X-1a:2001", "gts_pdfxversion": "PDF/X-1:2001", "keywords": "Department of Health & Human Services USA; Electronic Health Records; EHR; Privacy; Security;", "moddate": "2013-02-07T14:33:58-05:00", "nccl_078003008-16080": "NCCL083126-59025", "nccl_078003008-16081": "NCCL-75-118-55087", "nccl_app": "PDF", "nccl_docid": "14492", "nccl_standard": "Section 508", "nccl_status": "Passed", "subject": "Privacy, Security, and Electronic Health Records", "title": "Privacy, Security, and Electronic Health Records", "trapped": "/False", "source": "backend\\data\\raw\\compliance\\privacy-security-electronic-records.pdf", "total_pages": 2, "page": 0, "page_label": "1", "doc_type": "compliance", "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "created_at": "2025-12-13T08:30:23.275231"}}

If your doctors’ systems can share information, one doctor can see test \nresults from another doctor, so the test doesn’t always have to be repeated. Especially with x-rays \nand certain lab tests, this means you are at less risk from radiation and other side effects. When \ntests are not repeated unnecessarily, it also means you pay less for your health care in copay­\nments and deductibles. \nMore Convenient Care. EHRs can alert providers to contact you when it is time for certain \nscreening tests. When doctors, pharmacies, labs, and other members of your health care team \nare able to share information, you may no longer have to fill out all the same forms over and \nover again, wait for paper records to be passed from one doctor to the other, or carry those \nrecords yourself. \n•\t \n•\t \nPrivacy, Security, and Electronic Health Records 2 \nKeeping Your Electronic Health Information Secure \nMost of us feel that our health information is private and should be protected.

The government \nalso created the HIPAA Security Rule to require specific protections to safeguard your electronic health \ninformation. A few possible measures that can be built in to EHR systems may include: \n“Access control” tools like passwords and PIN numbers, to help limit access to your information \nto authorized individuals. \n“Encrypting” your stored information. That means your health information cannot be read or un­\nderstood except by those using a system that can “decrypt” it with a “key.” \nAn “audit trail” feature, which records who accessed your information, what changes were made \nand when. \n•\t \n•\t \n•\t \nFinally, federal law requires doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers to notify you of a \n“breach.” The law also requires the health care provider to notify the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. If a breach affects more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, the health care provider \nmust also notify prominent media outlets serving the state or jurisdiction.
